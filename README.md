# Object Method Challenge
Below are 4 descriptions that will need to turn into an object. Each object has at least one property and a method. For the 5th description, you are asked to create your own object that contains a property and a method.

1. A **hotel** with two properties called **totalRooms** and **bookedRooms**. The values for both properties can be any number. A **remainingRooms()** method (VERSION 2 - ES6) should return the remaining number of rooms that a hotel has. Console.log a message that says, "There are `##` of rooms available for booking." The ## in this message should be referenced dynamically from the remainingRooms()method. 

2. A **Forest Gump** with the property called **"thing"**. The value should be set of chocolates. A **sayQuote()** method (VERSION 2 - Key/Value Pair) will result in a console.log that says "My momma always said, 'Life was like a box of `chocolates`. You never know what you're gonna get.'" The thing "chocolate" in this message should be referenced dynamically from the property. 

3. A **Instacart** with a property **"items"** initialized to an **empty array**. A method **addItem()** (VERSION 2 - ES6) with one parameter, that will eventually add one item to the items array. Console.log the items property to display the items that are currently in the shopping cart.

4. A **rocket** with the property called **"name"**. The name of the rocket is called "Apollo 11". A **startLaunch()** method (VERSION 1) will result in a JavaScript **alert** that says, "ignition sequence start for the `Apollo 11` ... 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ..." This method will also console.log a message that says "launched". The name "Apollo 11" in this message should be referenced dynamically from the property. Remember to call the method.

5. Create your own object and give it **at least one property** and **at least one method**. You can use any version to create the methods, Then call one of the methods you created. Use your imagination!
